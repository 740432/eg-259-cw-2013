As distributed, this is a dummy app. It behaves as I want the final app
to behave but it uses traditional server fetches to change pages. In the
final app, the first coursework requires that you get user interface to
work as a Single Page App (SPA) using JavaScript to react to the page
and redraw just the parts that need to change.

The second coursework will build upon this app to allow the download of
data in a JSON format from a Restful API and the upload of student selections, also in JSON, via an Ajax call.

The styles and basic JavaScript dependencies are set up for you.
